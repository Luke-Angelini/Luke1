<ul>
  <li>Stress: a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances</li>
  <li>Stress is prominent in many places</li>
  <li>Getting a good thing happen on one day usually does not change our happiness multiple months down the road, so we should try to implement small changes in our life everyday.</li>
  <li>Just because we know something, it does not mean it will benefit us unless we put it into practice.</li>
  <li>Need to do different things, like how people do different exercises in the gym.</li>
  <li>While we need a decent amount of material possessions(money, food, clothing, etc.), at a certain point, having bigger and better does not improve happiness levels.</li>
  <li>Make social connection</li>
  <li>Social connection: the feeling that you belong to a group and generally feel close to other people</li>
  <li>Important to make time to spend with friends and family away from homework.</li>
  <li>Help others</li>
  <li>Helping others can help us by making us feel good about ourselves</li>
  <li>Treat yourself</li>
  <li>No matter how you treat yourself for accomplishments, you can gain important benefits.</li>
  <li>Make time for gratitude</li>
  <li>Show gratitude for your situation and the other people around you who help you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gratitude">
<a class="anchor" href="#gratitude" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gratitude</h2>

<p>Gratitude helps to keep us grounded. It helps us to ensure we remember all of the positive sides of life that sometimes become clouded through our ambition or stress.</p>

<p>As for things I am grateful for, I would say there are a few. The biggest are my family and my close friends, in both cases I have been blessed to have been given loving and appreciative individuals who want to help me succeed. I am also very grateful for the place in middle class society that I have been born into with all its benefits such as easy access to food, shelter, and devices like the computer I am typing with right now. And finally I would say I am grateful for the staff of this school for doing such a great job in helping me to learn.</p>

<p>My experience with a note of gratitude: I gave my note of gratitude to my dad. He was a bit surprised upon hearing it, and he seemed very pleased with what I had told him.</p>

<p>Goals
Goals can help an individual feel a sense of progress. I think goals are great ways to divide up tasks, which can lead to less stress. When creating goals, I like to have more specific goals.</p>

<p>My Personal Goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work on homework before the night before it’s due</li>
  <li>Sleep for at least 8 hours each night</li>
  <li>Try and put in an extra hour each day on some school or personal project</li>
</ul>

<p>Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to applications will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier.</p>
