<p>Red Hat used GPL code but, because of their size, were able to get people to pay for support for their code.</p>

<p>Most software is free because everyone in the world contributes to this code and then companies can create paid additional services that go along with the code, like hardware or support services.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Malware often causes a machine to malfunction. Sometimes money is asked for to fix it-ransomeware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep your private information safe and do not give it away on the internet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notes</li>
  <li>Companies need to make money in order to survive. The obvious way for a software company to do this would be to keep their code closed source and sell it. However, as a lot of code is open source and being developed by people all around the world as open source, it is sometimes beneficial for a company to take this code and create auxillery services. Services like these could be hardware that uses this code, support services for the code, or other ways that use the code without including it in code of their own.</li>
  <li>My code uses the Apache-2.0 license</li>

<ol>
  <li>Some websites for software that we use require usernames and passwords which are credentials for access. Additionally many groups are creating projects that require credentials for access.</li>
  <li>I think that I am relatively secure in the information I give out. I do have an Instagram account so information like name, age, and residence are on the internet. However I am very secure with other information and do not use any other social media sites.</li>
  <li>A goode passwords includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters and is relatively long. A password like this will be difficult to guess.</li>
  <li>Assymetric encryption uses a public key which multiple people have access to to encrypt the information and a private key to decrypt it. Symmetric encryption uses only one secret key is used for both encryption and decryption.</li>
  <li>We aysymmetric encryption because we used one key which was a class key.</li>
  <li>I was asked for an email by a website once and input it without thinking why it was needed. Because of this I ended up getting spam emails. Other forms of phishing scams include emails pretending to be corporations like PayPal or Amazon and asking for your account information.</li>
