<h1 id="main-idea">
<a class="anchor" href="#main-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main idea</h1>

<p>The basic idea is to create a simple website using a feature where users can enter text to post it, submit a post, and then see all the posts of other users. Users would then be able to like or dislike a post. The posts with the most likes and least dislikes will be shown at the top of the page.</p>

<p>Posts would be shown anonymously so I would not be creating a login system. Additionally, posts could be deleted by a user or administrator.</p>

<h1 id="additional-feature">
<a class="anchor" href="#additional-feature" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Feature</h1>

<p>As a way to make use of lists for the CPT requirement I had an idea to make a feature where when a certain string of text is put into a post the website would automatically generate another post with some random text in it. Some key phrase like SURPRISEME which would then cause the random text to appear.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-need-to-learn">
<a class="anchor" href="#things-i-need-to-learn" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Things I Need to Learn</h1>

<p>I still don’t know how to do most of the things I’ll need to be able to do for this. But I think most of these features are achievable with the resources available to me. For the website itself I’ll need to go over hosting with AWS again as well as what I need to do to actually create a page. Then I’ll need to practice some htmnl to learn how to create a basic frontend.</p>

<p>From there I have an idea of what I need to do for the first feature. I’ll have to collect the data for posts with an input system and then store the data about posts (likes, dislikes, and the content of a post) with a table. Then the content of the posts will need to be displated on the main page.</p>

<p>For the additional feature I was thinking of calling on an API to get the random text so I’ll need to learn how to use an API and ideally how to make one so that I can make a list of random texts to use.</p>

<h1 id="task-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#task-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Task 1:</h1>

<p>Work on frontend of website.</p>

<p>Theme: Movie Voting</p>

<p>Title: Best Films</p>

<p>Figure out aesthetics. Include pictures, what posts will look like etc.</p>
