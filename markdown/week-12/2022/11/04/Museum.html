<p>Night at the Museum was certainly very interesting this trimester and our group got to go around and see a lot of the creativity this school has to offer. As for ourselves, our presentation went well and we were able to show off our Practice Nexus project. But, of course there was copious amounts of talent outside of the APCSP class.</p>

<p>At the 3D animation display we saw a very tasty design style.</p>

<p>Possibly some of the most skillful work I saw at night at the museum, and also some of the most practical. Truly it is a very useful artform, however, I must say the piece a fellow classmate Varalu dubbed the “Bananolphin” was my personal favorite.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#painting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Painting</h1>

<p>If the pottery was the most skillful the painting was certainly the most beautiful with this stunning landscape here being just one of the great pieces I found</p>

<p>Cat or dog person? This artist clearly has a preference</p>
