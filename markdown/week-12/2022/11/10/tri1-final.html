<p>Overall this tri has been a very educational first look into coding more broadly for me. I started out my interest in the subject with a very basic youtube Python tutorial and have come out of this trimester using not only Python but also HTML and javascript and making programs using APIs and AWS. It has been a very quick experience but I have also learned a lot in this short bit of time.</p>

<p>As for the final itself it mostly went over some program fundamentals we learned while working with the code as well as some principles of coding in a team and what an application should do.</p>

<p>As for my performance on the quiz I feel I did pretty good. I had a bit of an issue with some of the more complicated questions about the code but given my score I think I had pretty good comprehension of most of the basic coding principles and the other topics included in the final as well.</p>

<p>Q1 Initializing result to 2 and multiplying it by 5 a total of three times yields 2(53), not 2(5×3). I was wrong because I failed to see that each instance of 5 was multiplying itself by the next and not that there were just 3 of them.</p>

<p>Q28 Incorrect. This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 for each of the first 25 units and $5 for each subsequent unit. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer 25 * $7 + 7 * $5 = $210 for the 32 units. Here I made a bit of a dumb mistake and confued the 7 and the 5 in the else line.</p>

<p>Q34 Incorrect. The code segment initially assigns an empty list to thirdList, but none of the lists are empty after the code segment is executed. Here I was mostly confused about how the variable replacement works.</p>

<p>Q41 Incorrect. This is the initial value of p. None of the variables has the value 10 after executing the code segment.Another one where I was confused about variable replacement.</p>

<p>Q48 Incorrect. The value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement. And a final question where I was once again confused about how variable replacement works.</p>
