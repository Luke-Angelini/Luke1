<ol>
  <li>Benefits and Harms of computing include: Greater access to data/loss of data privacy, less need to pay for human expertise/loss of jobs, greater leisure experiences/dopamine addictions.</li>
  <li>Modern social media sites and games are often designed to retain user attention for as long as possible in order to show us advertisements or get us to spend on and become attached to the games. This creates a large conflict of interest where the consumer just sees a good way to relax, but the seller sees a potentially endless machine of profit. This leads to companies creating products that are addictive and not created in the userâ€™s best interest, but instead mostly for the interest of profit.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="52-hacks-response">5.2 Hacks Response</h1>

<ol>
  <li>To empower themselves in a digital world one must both have access to an adequate computing device with connection to the internet as well as the education on how to use that device.</li>
  <li>Someone empowered can help someone not empowered by either teaching them how to use a device or by donating funds or the device itself to them if they do not already have one.</li>
  <li>The barriers to digital empowerment are often simply that some low income families do not have access to as much technology. At Del Norte this is much less of an issue.</li>
</ol>
