<p>I don’t think that the designers of the computers were racist. I can imagine that they aren’t exactly thorough testers, but not racist. Mostly I think it is ignorance on the testers part as they probably aren’t black and so when they were testing they weren’t able to get any testing done with black faces meaning the software doesnt recognize the significantly different facial features.</p>

<h1 id="crowdsource-project">Crowdsource Project</h1>

<p>One idea is a survey on whether or not the AP College Board should allow students to use Chat GPT and redesign the rest with that in mind.</p>

<p>For my project specifically I could create a survey about potential features for a chat website and also phrases to use for the random aspect. I could possibly collect random phrases and add them to the API.</p>
